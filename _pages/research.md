### **Research Implementations**
**AttackerNet: False Data Injection Attack on Remote State Estimation**
* Proposed an algorithm for attacking remote state estimator by injecting false data and fooling the standard $\chi{}^2$ false data detector leading to a large estimation error and system failure.
* Trained two neural networks (DefenderNet and AttackerNet) simultaneously using stochastic gradient descent
for solving two different non-differentiable constrained optimization problems.
* AttackerNet maximizes the process estimation error while keeping a low attack detection probability.

**Novel Representation of HRTFs using Hemispherical Harmonics**
* Modelled Head Related Transfer Functions(HRTFs) using Hemi-Spherical Harmonics (HSH) function to
reduce structural complexities and improve the perception.
* Used Singular value decomposition and regularization to implement linear regression for a sparse design
matrix to represent HRTFs using HSH as basis functions.
