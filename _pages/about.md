My name is Anshul Yadav, and I am currently a Junior Undergraduate in [Electrical Engineering](http://ee.iitd.ernet.in/) at [Indian Institue of Technology Delhi](http://www.iitd.ac.in/). I am interested in Deep Learning, Pattern Recognition, Computer Vision, Speech Processing and Recognition and Robotics.
<br><br>
I am working with <a href = "http://web.iitd.ac.in/~lalank/">Professor Lalan Kumar</a> (Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Delhi), to write a paper on <i>Novel representation of Head Related Transfer Functions using Hemispherical Harmonics</i> from Spring, 2019 and with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/arpanchattop/">Professor Arpan Chattopadhyay</a> (Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Delhi) on detecting false data injection and proposing defense strategies for it. <!-- Our system comprises of a number of sensors which are observing some process and sending the data to a remote estimator. These sensors are prone to attacks of various kinds. --> We are also investigating the possibility of attack/defense using Generative adversarial Networks(GANs).

In Summer 2017, I worked on PS4 controlled robotic arm with gripper achieving three degress of freedom. I simultaneously worked to program two Javascript modules for testing field view of vision and contrast for partially blind patients to eliminate the existing costly methods. I worked on binaural sound synthesis after my fascination with signal processing in the Fall 2018, and I successfully partnered with my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amantiwari1503/">Aman Tiwari</a> produced binaural sound using MIT’s HRTF data. In Winter 2018, I contributed to designing a multilevel DC to AC converter using CIPOS mini IC’s. Along with the help of a Masters student, I designed single multilevel converters and programmed to get a multilevel converter, performing the signal test, overcurrent protection tests etc.

I used to lead Robotics Club at IIT Delhi, where we designed and developed drives(holonomic, mecanum etc), multi legged locomotive robots, ROS based differential drive etc.

On a side for fun I [blog]({{ site.url }}/blog.html), [tweet](https://twitter.com/anshulyadav1911), [open source](https://github.com/anshul3899) my projects and watch movies and Japanese Manga!

### Miscellaneous
* I come from Rewari, Haryana. In the past, I have also lived in Ahmedabad and New Delhi.
* [Here](https://anshul3899.github.io/mlrg-iitd/) is the Machine Learning Reading Group, I founded along with my friend [Anchit Tandon](https://twitter.com/anchit_tandon) in IIT Delhi.
* I spend a lot of time watching movies & binging Japanese Anime. [Here]({{ site.url }}/anime) is the list of animes I have watched.
* Whenever I am not thinking about research, I enjoy most of outdoor activities including Trekking, Hockey, Soccer and Cycling.
