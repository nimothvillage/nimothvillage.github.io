Outlining my non-research,  academic projects as well as hacks here. My research work can be seen [here](/research/).

**Implementation of Machine Learning algorithms and Deep Learning architectures :**
* Implemented standard machine learning algorithms like Bayes classifier, Naive Bayes classifier, k-nearest
neighbours, Parzen window, k-means clustering, Expectation Maximization etc from scratch.
* Implemented and trained state of the art image classification Neural Network architectures like LeNet,
AlexNet, ResNet etc in PyTorch.
* Studied and implemented Generative Models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Wasserstein
GANs, Variational Autoencoders, Gaussian Mixture Models etc.

**Simultaneous Perturbation for Stochastic Approximation (SPSA)**
* Implemented Wulff et al.’s paper titled “SPSA for Layer-Wise Training of Deep Networks” from scratch.
* Analyzed and compared the convergence and performance of SPSA with other popular algorithms like Adam,
RMSprop, SGD etc for optimizing neural networks.

<!-- **5 Staged Pipelined processor in Logisim**
* Designed a 5 staged SimpleRisc Processor with pipelining and forwarding
* -->

<!-- **Implementation of Cipher Algorithms in Logisim**
*
* -->

**Field of View Tester and Contrast Tester Javascript Modules**
* Developed two Javascript modules for testing field view of vision and visible contrast in visually impaired.
* Designed an algorithm to generate random points over complete area and fine-tuned the boundary of vision.
* Implemented a logarithmic algorithm which converges in 7-8 steps to accurately find visible contrast in RGB.

**Stock Prediction using Support Vector Regression**
* Used linear, polynomial and radial basis function to implement kernelized learning using Support Vector
Regression and experimented with different thresholds.
* Predicted and analysed stock prices by training monthly stock dataset fetched using Yahoo Finance API.

**Data structure for Mobile Phone Tracking System**
* Implemented a central server consisting of phone exchange nodes at different levels and mobile phones of
each exchange.
* Created hierarchical Routing Map Tree Structure using k-ary trees, linked lists, sets etc to solve the mobile
phone routing problem.

**PS3 controlled Robotic Arm with Gripper**
* Designed a robotic arm with 4R-four-bar mechanism having 3 degrees of freedom to grip small objects.
* Programmed Mega ADK to actuate shoulder and arm using servos and turntable base using Stepper motor.
