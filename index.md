My name is Anshul Yadav, and I am a Junior Undergraduate in Electrical Engineering at [Indian Institue of Technology Delhi](http://iitd.ac.in). I am interested in Deep Learning, Pattern Recognition, Computer Vision, Speech Processing and Recognition and Robotics.

I maintain a list of my research projects and implementations under the [Research]({{ site.url }}/research) tab. To get an insight on my professional life so far, you can have a look at my [CV]({{ site.url }}/cv).

I [blog]({{ site.url }}/blog.html) the journey of an Electrical Engineer delving deeper into Neural Networks and Machine Learning every now and then compiling my personal experiences. Feel free to read a bit [more about me]({{ site.url }}/about)!
